# w6-ss-api-weather

Week Six Challenge of the *UOB Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp* requires students to use Server-Side APIs and local storage to create a **Weather Dashboard**. 

We were given a User Story and an Acceptance Criteria as per below:

## How I approached the task:

* Analysed starter code, and used Bootstrap grid with existing CSS to build timeblocks. 

* Used Moment.js to dynamically display current time, and to check if time block isBefore(), isAfter() or same as current time. 

**Dynamic time display:**

```
var update = function(){
    var now = moment();
    $("#currentDay").text(now.format("dddd, Do MMMM YYYY, h:mm:ss a"));
} 
setInterval(update, 1000);
```

* Used jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation and event methods, including .click(), .show(), .hide(), -each().

When the user clicks the Save icon, a notification pops up for three seconds, to confirm the entry has been saved to local storage.

Past, present and future time blocks are colour coded and is updated dynamically.

Users have the option to clear all entries, or individually overwrite old entries.
